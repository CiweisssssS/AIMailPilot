Thanks again for your detailed plan — I’d like to move forward tonight with a more complete version of the Web App.

In addition to your current tasks (Web App setup + GPT-4o-mini optimization),  
please include the following updates:

---

🎯 **Goal**
Build a Web Application that:
1. Allows me to **log in with my Gmail test account** via Google OAuth  
2. **Fetches the latest few emails** (subject, sender, body) automatically  
3. Sends them to GPT-4o-mini for processing  
4. Displays:  
   - Priority classification (P1/P2/P3)  
   - One-sentence summary  
   - Formatted tasks → `[verb + object + owner + due]`  
   - Deadline  

---

🎨 **Frontend Requirement (Figma UI)**
Use my Figma design as the visual reference for the Web App UI.  
Here’s the Dev Mode link:  
👉 https://www.figma.com/design/p2k7tcgxQzWC2H5EHaS3Iq/Untitled?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=27DyxvgCAmAln0qZ-1  

Please match the layout, spacing, color palette, and typography exactly.  
The layers in the Figma correspond to the app sections (Inbox overview, Priority view, Task detail, Chatbot panel).  
The goal is to achieve a clean and cohesive design that can later be extended into a Chrome extension.

⚙️ **Technical Requirements**
- Frontend: React + Tailwind  
- Backend: FastAPI (use existing endpoints `/triage` and `/chatbot`)  
- Authentication: Google OAuth 2.0 (scope: `gmail.readonly`)  
- Data flow:
  1. User logs in → Gmail access token stored securely  
  2. Backend calls Gmail API → retrieves latest emails  
  3. GPT-4o-mini analyzes → returns structured JSON  
  4. UI renders priority, summary, tasks, and deadlines  

---

🧠 **Prompt & Model Updates**
- Refine GPT-4o-mini prompt to ensure:
  - Correct priority classification (P1 / P2 / P3)
  - Accurate task extraction with `[verb + object + owner + due]`
  - One concise summary sentence
  - A clear deadline (if detected)
- Return results in structured JSON for easy rendering

---

✅ **Expected Result**
Within the Web App:
- I can log in with my Gmail test account  
- Automatically fetch recent emails  
- Click “Analyze” → instantly see:
  - Priority classification  
  - Summary sentence  
  - Structured task list  
  - Deadline  

Once this version works correctly, we’ll migrate the same structure to the Apps Script add-on or build it into a Chrome extension later.
