We need to optimize the Task & Schedule UI layout — the current rendering (see Screenshot #1) is truncating and visually inconsistent with the intended design (see Screenshot #2).

======================================
Observed Issues (Current Screenshot #1)
======================================
1. **Content Clipping / Truncation**
   - The task text (subject line) is partially cut off (“Subject: Review pitch deck…”).
   - Important task details are hidden, forcing the user to guess the full content.

2. **Labeling Inconsistency**
   - The label currently uses “Subject:” but our target design uses “Task:” for clarity and alignment with the overall system vocabulary.
   - This should be updated globally in this section.

3. **Layout Compression**
   - Cards appear visually dense, with minimal vertical spacing and padding.
   - The text area is too narrow, causing premature ellipsis even when space is available.
   - The card container does not adapt flexibly to text height.

4. **Readability**
   - Line height and font weight hierarchy are not visually balanced.
   - The visual rhythm between time and task text is broken — time is cramped too close to the first line.

======================================
Expected Outcome (Target = Screenshot #2)
======================================
Reference: the provided Screenshot #2 represents the expected visual structure and spacing.  

Key visual + functional requirements:

✅ **Task Label**
- Use label “Task:” instead of “Subject:”.
- Ensure the task title (e.g., “Review updated pitch deck – Agenda Attached”) is fully visible without truncation.
- Implement smart wrapping: allow 2–3 lines max before ellipsis.

✅ **Time Line Display**
- Each item starts with:
  - “Time:” followed by date and hour in “Mon DD, HH:mm” format (24h).
  - Example: “Time: Oct 5, 10:00 AM”
- Time line bullet aligns vertically through all cards (see Screenshot #2).

✅ **Card Layout**
- Increase vertical spacing between timeline dots (~12–16px).
- Maintain consistent padding inside each card (at least 12px top/bottom, 16px left/right).
- Card width auto-adjusts to accommodate full text up to two lines.
- If wrapping occurs, ensure time and task lines remain aligned (no indentation shifts).

✅ **Typography**
- Font hierarchy:
  - Time line label: smaller, gray (#6B6B6B)
  - Task title: medium-bold, primary text (#2E2E2E)
  - Section headings (e.g., “Today”, “This Week”, “This Month”): larger and bold with extra top margin.
- Ellipsis only triggers after 2–3 lines, not single-line truncation.

✅ **Section Titles & Timeline**
- Maintain “Today”, “This Week”, “This Month”, “Later” sections, separated with clear spacing (see Screenshot #2).
- Vertical timeline line and nodes must stay visually aligned with each card block.
- Node colors: darker for active (today), lighter for later tasks.

✅ **Responsive Behavior**
- The card must resize smoothly on smaller windows (no clipping).
- Test with both short and long subject lines — all text should be visible up to two lines.

======================================
Acceptance Criteria
======================================
- All task cards show the **full task title** up to 2 lines (no cutoff like Screenshot #1).
- “Subject:” is replaced globally with “Task:”.
- Time label uses consistent “Time: Mon DD, HH:mm” format.
- Timeline bullets vertically aligned across sections.
- Each section header (“Today”, “This Week”, etc.) spaced clearly with consistent typography.
- Layout visually matches Screenshot #2 reference — same hierarchy, spacing, and alignment.

Please adjust card sizing, padding, and typography to achieve the design fidelity shown in Screenshot #2.
