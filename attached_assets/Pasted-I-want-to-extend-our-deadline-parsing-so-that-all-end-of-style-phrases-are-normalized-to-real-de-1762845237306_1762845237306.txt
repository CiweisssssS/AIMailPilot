I want to extend our deadline parsing so that all “end of …” style phrases are normalized to real deadlines instead of falling back to "TBD".

Current issue:
Right now, expressions like “by the end of tomorrow” or “please confirm by the end of this week” are not matched by our existing patterns in app/utils/deadline_utils.py, so they fall through to the final “no match → TBD” branch. This makes the UI show “Deadline: TBD” even though the user clearly provided a time boundary.

What to do:
Please add a new parsing block in app/utils/deadline_utils.py right after the current EOD/today handling and before the generic "tomorrow" / date parsing, to handle all “end of …” patterns.

Patterns to support (all case-insensitive):
- "end of today", "by the end of today"
- "end of tomorrow", "by the end of tomorrow", "tomorrow EOD"
- "end of <weekday>" (end of Monday, end of Friday, by Friday EOD)
- "end of this week", "by the end of this week", "by EOW", "before the week ends"
- "end of next week"
- "end of this month", "end of next month"
- "end of this quarter", "end of the quarter"

Mapping rules:
1. end of today → today at WORK_END_HOUR
2. end of tomorrow / tomorrow EOD → tomorrow at WORK_END_HOUR
3. end of <weekday> → find the next occurrence of that weekday (relative to email sent date if available, otherwise now) and set time to WORK_END_HOUR
4. end of this week / EOW → this week’s Friday at WORK_END_HOUR
5. end of next week → next week’s Friday at WORK_END_HOUR
6. end of this month → last day of this month at WORK_END_HOUR
7. end of next month → last day of next month at WORK_END_HOUR
8. end of this quarter → last day of the current quarter at WORK_END_HOUR

Important:
- Reuse the same “work end hour” as a configurable value (e.g. WORK_END_HOUR = 17) so we can change it later.
- Keep the existing ambiguous list (asap, sometime, around, next week without “end of”) as TBD.
- Keep the existing output format "Mon DD, YYYY, HH:MM".
- When computing “next week” or “this week”, use the email’s sent timestamp as the reference if available, not just the current system time.

Goal:
After this change, phrases like “confirm your attendance by the end of tomorrow” should produce a concrete deadline (tomorrow at the configured work end hour) instead of "TBD".
